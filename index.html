            of immense skill on a quest to find and eliminate all Gears and their creator, That Man. For a short time, Sol was also 
            a member of the Sacred Order of Holy Knights and fought in the Crusades. This past version of him is known as "Order-Sol".</p>

        <p>Dizzy is one of the main characters of the Guilty Gear series. An innocent and pacifist Commander-Type half-Gear, Dizzy is 
            the daughter of Justice, who once waged war on humanity, but grew up unaware of her origins. The names of Dizzy's shapeshifting 
            wings, also called her systems, are Necro, the Grim Reaper-like wing, and Undine, the blue angel wing.</p>

            which sustain and guide him through all manner of shaking uncertainties.</p>
